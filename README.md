# Pacman Coded in Python - FINAL PROJECT by Michael Graham and Thomas Turon

Pacman is 2-dimensional game where the user controls a figure known as Pacman. All Pacman wants to do is travel around in a maze and eat coins and fruit. The user can control Pacman using the arrow keys, which will navigate him around the walls. But, there are enemies known as ghosts that are constantly chasing Pacman. These ghosts try to kill Pacman and take away his lives. But, if Pacman manages to navigate around the ghosts and maze walls, he has the opportunity to eat all the coins and fruit which makes him VICTORIOUS!


## How to Play Pacman

Once the game is run, the user will be prompted with a start-up screen asking the user to push the space bar. Once the spacebar is
clicked, the game of Pacman will start. After the game starts, the ghosts will be released from their cage and they will start chasing Pacman. The user can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate Pacman around the maze and away from the ghosts. Pacman cannot run through walls, so the user must skillfully navigate him through the complex maze with the arrow keys to stay alive. Once Pacman has lost all of his lives or has eaten all of the fruit and coins, the game will end and the user will be prompted to press the spacebar to play again, or to click the escape key to quit.
